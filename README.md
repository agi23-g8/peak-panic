# Peak Panic

A local multiplayer skiing game where you have keep up the pace so you don't fall behind! Each player control their character through their phone by tilting it left and right.

A player is eliminated when going outside of view of the camera. The slope is filled with obstacles such as trees and rolling snow balls that you have to avoid. Additionally, there are speed boosts which each player can pick up in order to gain an advantage.
